#Neighborhood Map
Neighborhood Map is a site that highlights some of the best food places in the South Suburbs of Chicago using the Google Maps API. In addition to the Google Maps API, the project was built using JavaScript, jQuery, Knockout.js and the Wikipedia API. The project demonstrates skills acquired and strengthened via [Udacity](http://www.udacity.com "Udacity") as part of its [Front-end nanodegree course](https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd001 "Udacity Front-End Nanodegree"). 

##Site Functunality
- "Show Listings" populates the map with markers that highlight the best food places in the South Burbs. This is especially useful after using the distance filter.
- "Hide Listings" removes the markers from the map, making viewing of search results easier.
- Click a location listing link to reveal location information on the map, including an image, a Wikipedia link and a link to the street view.
- Click a marker on the map to reveal the same information as is revealed when the corresponding side link is clicked.
- Filter locations according to how far they are (driving) from your searched destination.
- Searching for nearby places will populate the map with markers to all of the types of places specified in your search.
- For each highlighted food place, the project searches Wikipedia and produces a link to its Wikipedia page in the marker's window. Some locations may not have a Wikipedia page yet.

##How To Use the Site
- Enter an address or location name in the "Search for nearby places" search box to populate the map with the desired search results. The results will include business name, address, phone number and opening hours if available.
- To find places within a specific distance from the food places highlighted in the project, enter an address or location name in the "Filter To Within..." search box. Select the amount of time you'd prefer to travel via the accompanying dropdown box. The map will populate with the results, including travel time and the option to "view route."
- To find out more information about the highlighted food places, click the markers on the map or the side links. The markers will show a window with the business name, an image of the business, a Wikipedia link and street view options.
